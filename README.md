# LFA-CV
This repository contains files related with designing and training a computer vision model that would correctly detect and classify the results of lateral flow assay (LFA) tests.

* To install relevant packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Need to add environment variable using `PYTHONPATH="path/to/your/directory:$PYTHONPATH` (or add the root directory to `sys.path` at top of each .py file)
